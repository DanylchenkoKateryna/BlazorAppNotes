# BlazorAppNotes
This repository contains a Blazor Server application built with a monolithic architecture, using Entity Framework Core for database access and PostgreSQL as the database. Xunit is used for testing.
## Introduction

This Blazor Server application is designed to showcase a monolithic architecture, where all components of the application are tightly integrated into a single codebase. It serves as an example of building a web application with .NET technologies.

### Features

- **Entity Framework**: Entity Framework is used for data access, making it easy to work with the PostgreSQL database.

- **Blazor Components**: The application is built using Blazor components for creating interactive web user interfaces.

- **Xunit Testing**: Xunit is used for writing and running unit tests to ensure code quality and reliability.

- **Monolithic Architecture**: All application components are bundled together in a monolithic structure, simplifying development and deployment.

## Getting Started
